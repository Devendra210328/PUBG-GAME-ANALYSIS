# PUBG Player Performance Prediction

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing game data and building predictive models using PUBG game data. The goal is to predict player performance based on in-game actions and statistics.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loaded raw PUBG game data for initial examination and understanding of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Anomaly Detection**
   - Conducted thorough cleaning of the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Engineered relevant features to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed EDA to uncover insights and relationships within the dataset.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Applied preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for model building, including normalization and encoding.

6. **Model Building with Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Built a predictive model using CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as RMSE and R² to assess prediction accuracy and the model's explanatory power.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, CatBoost

## Results

The final model’s performance, measured by RMSE and R², provides insights into how well in-game actions and statistics can predict a player's final standing in a PUBG match. The project showcases a methodical approach to solving a complex prediction problem and highlights skills in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
